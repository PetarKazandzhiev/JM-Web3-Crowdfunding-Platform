#Web3 Blockchain Crowdfunding Platform

This repository houses a Crowdfunding Platform built using Web3 and Solidity, following an online tutorial. The application serves as a decentralized platform allowing users to create, view, and donate to various crowdfunding campaigns through blockchain technology.

#Noteworthy Amendments

During the tutorial, I identified and rectified a couple of errors in the original code:

Resolved an issue with the connection to the smart contract when getting donators.
Resolved an issue on the frontend side.
These changes have made the application more robust and efficient.

#Learning Curve

Through the course of this project, I delved deeper into Solidity and deployed my very first Solidity contract. Moreover, it served as a practical learning experience to understand how to establish a connection between an application and a smart contract. This hands-on project offered a comprehensive insight into creating, viewing, and donating to crowdfunding campaigns, all by harnessing the power of blockchain technology.
